If Lagnadhipati is in Lagna and aspected by evil planets, the results produced will be quite different from those which he would have produced by being aspected by benefics. The same rules apply to all Bhavas which should be borne in mind by every reader.

They are very reserved and are liable to draw premature conclusions on any matter. They are God-fearing and very rigid in the observance of religious customs and practices. They are stubborn, rather timid, and ambitious to exercise
			authority over others. They rarely realise their ambitions. They are restless and fond of history, antiquarian talks and mythological masterpieces. They are frugal in spending money and though generally dependent upon others throughout their life, still bear a mark of independence. They are just in their dealings and fear to transgress the laws of truth. With all this they lack self-confidence.
